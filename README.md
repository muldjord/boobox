# BooBox
A fun Raspberry Pi Pico W project that combines a few pieces of hardware to create an IoT talking skull.

Whenever the motion detector triggers The Pico fetches a sound from the provided TCP server and plays it through the speaker. The servo motor matches the sound data to allowing for a skull or other animatronic to open and close its mouth while the sound plays.
